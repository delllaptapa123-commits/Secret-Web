    <h3><a>Hi, I am Nolan, and i'm one of the victims of this Secret Web, and I have entered this website and can't get back out to the outside world anymore... But I had a strange experience after seeing this Secret Web!</a></h3>
    <h3><a>So, this story begins on April 5, 2025, when I was still in elementary school. At that time, I was just casually browsing some websites that I hadn't explored before. Suddenly, I found the Secret Web and then I clicked on it. At first, I was hesitant, but over time, I became very curious. I didn't realize I had been browsing the Secret Web for an hour and then I went out. It was raining outside. When I tried to visit my friend's house, I suddenly saw the shadow of a wolf from outside and then I lost consciousness. I woke up in a bright white room and then that was my last moment in the outside world!</a></h3><h3><a href="man.html">By Nolan, 27-December-2025</a></h3>
