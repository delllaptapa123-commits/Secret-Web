        <h3><a>This story begins on February 13, 2012, when a small family from Sweden bought a teddy bear for their child. On the first night after the teddy bear was purchased, it was still safe, but oddities began to appear on the second night, such as the teddy bear suddenly moving or disappearing for a moment. On November 15, 2013, strangely, the small family disappeared, leaving behind a teddy bear that had been torn to pieces by someone.</a></h3>
        <h3><a>The bear's name is Mr. Href, or sometimes called Mr. Gorane. However, Gorane itself is the name of an old woman who happens to be in the same location as the little family, specifically in a village where she is a ghost.</a></h3>
