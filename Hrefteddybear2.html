    <h3><a></a>Hi friends! It seems like I have a new story! Back then, November 18, 2016, I met a small family who apparently adopted me in 2012-2013. At that time they really missed my presence. When I asked about them why they disappeared in front of me, their answer was so terrible. They said that in 2013 they were kidnapped by skinwalkers and taken to the Pentiga Jupah supernatural forest. At that time I also decided to immediately get out of that place through one of the paths that was not blocked by the creator of the supernatural forest, namely, through a narrow cave. Luckily I managed to get through the narrow cave safely. That's my story, friends! It seems like I still have many other strange stories but in another room and see you again!</h3>
