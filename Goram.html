    <h3><a>Goram. Yes, that's right, in this room, you'll be given information regarding what Goram means.</a></h3>
    <h3><a>Goram is a legendary ghost from the Pentiga Jupah forest and is Gorane's younger brother. Gorane lived in the real world until his death at the age of 77, while Goram himself died at birth. Legend has it that Goram wanders the Pentiga Jupah forest, searching for his older brother, Gorane, disguised as a village girl. He asks anyone he encounters for help finding his missing brother.</a></h3>
    <h3><a>Until now, it is not known where Goram is, but what is clear is that the last time Goram was roaming the Pentiga Jupah forest was in 2018 and until now there has been no news about Goram.</a></h3>
